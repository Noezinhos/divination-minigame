# Divination Minigame

## Overview
**Divination Minigame** is my first project, created as a simple and fun guessing game. The goal is to guess a secret number within a predefined range, using the fewest possible attempts.

## How It Works
- The player must guess a number between **1** and **100**.
- The game provides hints if the correct number is higher or lower than the player's guess.
- The player has up to **10 attempts** to guess the secret number.
- After all attempts are used or the player guesses correctly, they can choose to play again.

## Features
- **Input Validation:** The game checks if the player's guess is valid (a number between **1** and **100**).
- **Attempt Counter:** The number of remaining attempts is displayed after each guess.
- **Replay Option:** After the game ends, the player can choose to start a new one.
